# Week 9 Project: The Boolean Hooligans Timetable


This project was created to address the issue of School of Code bootcampers feeling behind or wanting to be more prepared before formal teaching. The app allows bootcampers to look ahead at the topic lists for the weeks and access useful resoucres. Bootcampers themselves can also add resources they think will be useful for other bootcampers.
